# ID-Assignment 2
This is an assignment regarding an online shopping website. There are many categories of clothes such as skirts,shirts and jeans etc. This is an interactive website where users are able to search for items they want and also see the different clothes available in the store.

# Design Process
Firstly, we made the homepage which is index.html and we made it interactive in a sense that users can click on the navigation bar and see where they are shopping at. Next, we moved on to creating the categories page where the different clothes are classified into the respective categories. We added fonts and colours to make the page more aesthetic to have a visually pleasing sight for the user. The shopping page can be viewed to see which items are available and can allow users to add items into the cart. We also added a contacts page where our contacts are available and the user is also able to subscribe to the shop's newsletter. The membership page would allow the user to store their details in the database as well as earn membership points when they purchase items from the store.

# Features
We plan to include lottie animation where applicable and also a membership page. As for the membership page, users will be prompted and asked whether they are interested to join the membership of our shop. If they are interested, there will be a page prompting for their particulars and these particulars will be kept in a database. For example if a user spends $30 in our shop, 30 points will be accumulated in their membership. If they spent over $50, $2 dollars can be deducted from their total and 50 points will be deducted from their total points.
